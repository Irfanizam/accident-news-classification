 At approximately 3:45 p.m. on April 2  2013  an employee was working as a tile  setter for Jeffrey Razook Tile. The firm installed ceramic tile. The employee  had been working for the company for approximately six months. At the time of  the incident  he was performing his daily duties. He was working within  proximity of an onsite coworker. The employee and the coworker were working  from 16-foot (4.9-meter) extension ladders caulking the edges of five  balconies. The employee reached over to his left  lost his balance  and fell  to the ground. He fell approximately 11 feet (3.4 meters). He sustained  bruises  contusions  and abrasions.

 At approximately 7:50 a.m. on September 7  2005  Employee #1 was part of a  three-man crew installing earth anchors at the base of an overhead power line  pole. He inserted a metal anchor rod into the anchor wrench that was attached  to the boom on a digger/derrick truck. The boom was also in contact with an  energized 14 400-volt overhead line. Employee #1 was electrocuted.              
 On June 23  2003  Employee #1  a lineman  and three coworkers were placing new  12 kilovolt conductors on utility poles in Anaheim  CA. The existing  equipment  which had 12 kilovolt circuits  needed to be reconfigured to  accommodate the new conductors. Employee #1 was in an International bucket  truck with a Versalift bucket assembly  while one of his coworkers  a  fifth-stage apprentice  worked with hot sticks and rubber gloves on the east  side of the pole opposite the bucket. Existing conductors had been placed  vertically instead of in the usual horizontal manner  so the work involved  moving the street side  neutral 12 kilovolt conductors to the field side pole  pin position. The neutral 12 kilovolt line had an unwanted crimp splice  connector sitting atop the insulator  so Employee #1 pulled off this connector  and clamped down the neutral line in the insulator. He then told the  apprentice coworker to climb down  since this particular job was completed.  The other coworkers  a groundman and the foreman  were also on the ground.  Then  for some reason  the material handler load indicator contacted the  energized phase  and a bucket control knob contacted the neutral wire   resulting in a phase-to-neutral flash. Employee #1 sustained second- and  third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body  primarily his upper torso.  Subsequent investigation revealed that at some point the insulating line hose  covering the field side phase had been removed. Employee #1 was also supposed  to be wearing rubber gloves  but his apprentice coworker was not sure if this  was true.                                                                       
 A local utility company hired an electrical contractor to install new  streetlighting at the corner of a hazardous intersection. The job required  installing one of the streetlights parallel to an existing 13.2-kilovolt  (phase-to-phase) overhead power line. The ground worker installed the  streetlighting hardware and supply cable on the pole  placed a synthetic nylon  sling with a choker hitch around the pole  and attached the sling to the load  line of a derrick truck. When the derrick lifted the pole to an upright  position  the derrick's tilt-pole plumber arms grasped the shaft of the pole.  The operator of the derrick truck swung the load around and began to set the  pole in a 1.8-meter-deep hole. The ground worker was securing the cargo straps  to the pole trailer as the derrick operator was setting the pole. When the  butt end of the pole contacted the bottom of the hole  the pole spun the  streetlight into the overhead line. The ground worker ran to the pole to try  to prevent it from contacting the overhead line. He was electrocuted when he  touched the supply cable on the pole. He had entry and exit wounds on his  right hand and right heel.                                                      
 A power line crew was replacing a broken utility pole. One of the employees on  the crew was standing on the side of the digger derrick  holding onto the side  of the truck with both hands. A second employee was reaching into the cab of  the truck with his right knee touching the running board. The ground was wet  from a rain and ice storm. As he was positioning the boom of the derrick  the  operator brought the boom into contact with a 13.2-kilovolt overhead power  line. The employee at the side of the truck was electrocuted. The employee  reaching into the truck received an electric shock and burns on his knee and  foot. He was hospitalized for his injuries.                                     
" At approximately 12:00 p.m. on July 16  2013  Employee #1  a carpenter  employed by a building and remodeling company  was performing residential  roofing work on a two-story house. He complained of being hot. Employee #1  came down from the roof to seek some shade. Coworker #1 found Employee #1  lying unconscious at the side of the house and called for emergency services.  A bystander began CPR. When emergency medical services arrived  they  transported Employee #1 to the local hospital. He arrived unresponsive with a  core temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit according to hospital records.  Employee #1 was transferred from the local hospital to a regional advanced  care hospital. He died at 12:16 a.m. on July 17  2013. According to the  subsequent investigation  the coroner's report listed the cause of death as  ""Acute Polysubstance Intoxication - Contributory Factors: Hyperthermia  (Temperature 104F)."" According to the local airport data taken at 1:00 p.m. on  July 16  2013  the weather had been clear  with an air temperature of 92  degrees Fahrenheit  51% humidity  a dew point of 71.1 degrees Fahrenheit  and  10 miles visibility. Due to the heat  the employer had its employees work a  split schedule (6:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. to dark)  had them take  hourly breaks  and made available to all employees cold water (bottled and  drink cooler)  ice  sports drinks  and soft drinks.

Employee #1 sustained fatal injuries and died within  the next 20-30 minutes.                                                         
 At approximately 1:00 p.m. on February 11  2013  Employee #1  a Forman  was  performing a regularly assigned task of a spotter in the attempt to direct  dump trucks on where to place the base material for the parking lot. The  employee was not wearing a safety vest and was located between the dump trucks  and the Cat 140 M motor grader (Serial Number 0m9d00299). A coworker  grader  operator  was spreading the base material from the dump trucks. The coworker  was looking at the base material and how he was spreading it and not the  location of the employee. The coworker ran over the employee's leg. Employee  #1 was transported to Cedars-Sinai hospital  where he was treated for a  fractured leg. The employee remained hospitalized for three days.               
 At approximately 11:30 a.m. on October 10  2012  Employee #1 was collecting  tickets from dump trucks  which were carrying gravel to a new roadway. One of  the dump trucks began backing up to dump its load for the grader to spread.  Employee #1 did not realize that the dump truck was traveling in reverse. The  dump truck struck and killed him.                                               
" On January 5  2012  Employee # 1 was working as a Truck Driver. Employee # 1  was delivered a load of rock to Bastrop High School baseball complex at Baron  Ballpark  utilizing a 1999 International 4700 dump truck. Employee # 2 loaded  the truck with approximately 5.09 tons of number seven rocks  and Employee #1  proceeded to drive to Baron Ballpark  which was approximately 0.9 to 1.2 miles  away. Employee # 1 backed the dump truck into the desired dump area. Employee  # 1 parked the truck  and from inside the cab  shifted the ""HOIST"" lever into  the ""RAISE"" position in order to raise the dump bed. He then shifted the ""PTO""  lever into the ""IN"" position in order to put the hydraulic fluid pump in gear.  Employee # 1 exited the cab of the truck and notice that she had not opened  the tailgate prior to raising the dump bed. Employee # 1 then got back into  the cab of the truck and shifted the ""HOIST"" lever to the ""LOWER"" position in  order to try to lower the dump bed so she could remove the chain from the  tailgate release lever and engage the lever. However  the dump bed would not  lower because the load of rocks had all shifted upon raising the dump bed  and  were resting against the tail gate  creating a counter- weight to the  hydraulic system; the imbalance of weight prevented the dump bed from being  able to be lowered. Employee # 1 proceeded to climb up into the dump bed with  a shovel and began shoveling rock out in order to reduce the amount of  counter-weight so the dump bed could be lowered and the tailgate release  engaged; the attempt was unsuccessful. She climbed out of the dump bed and up  onto a set of the rear tires and proceeded to utilize the shovel to try to  reach high enough to undo the tailgate lever chain and engage the tailgate  lever; the attempts were unsuccessful. Finally  Employee # 1 climbed up onto  the portion of the truck frame directly behind the rear of the cab. She was  standing underneath the raised dump bed  facing the rear window of the cab.  From this position  she successfully proceeded to use the shovel to  undo/unlatch the tailgate release chain and engage the tailgate release  lever/switch. Immediately upon engaging the tailgate release lever  the  tailgate opened and released the load of rock  which removed the  counter-weight that was working against the hydraulic system. The dump bed  lowered swiftly onto Employee #1. Employee # 1 was crushed as she was caught  in between the rear of the cab and the dump bed. Employee # 1 died at the  scene.                                                                          "
